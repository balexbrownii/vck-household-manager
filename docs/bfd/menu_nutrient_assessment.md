## OVERALL SCORE: 95/100 (Excellent)

---

## FAMILY PROFILE

| Name | Age | MTHFR Status | Supplements | Priority |
|------|-----|--------------|-------------|----------|
| Alex (Dad) | 48 | Homozygous A1298C | Methylated vitamins, CoQ10 (stopped L-carnitine 11/2025) | High (temp low-TMAO) |
| Victoria (Mom) | 44 | Heterozygous A1298C | Methylated vitamins, CoQ10, L-carnitine, Leucovorin | Moderate |
| Elise | 13 | Homozygous A1298C | Methylated vitamins, L-carnitine, Leucovorin | High |
| Alexander | 11 | Heterozygous A1298C | Methylated vitamins, L-carnitine, Leucovorin | Moderate |
| Simone | 8 | Untested | - | Follow protocol |

**Homozygous A1298C (Alex, Elise):** ~70% reduced BH4 enzyme function
**Heterozygous A1298C (Victoria, Alexander):** ~35% reduced BH4 enzyme function

**Supplement Strategy:**
- Methylated vitamins bypass MTHFR enzyme limitation
- CoQ10 supports mitochondrial function (common in MTHFR)
- L-carnitine supports energy metabolism
- Leucovorin provides active folate directly

## GAPS & WEAKNESSES

### Missing Top 10 Nutrient-Dense Foods:

| Food | Rank | Status | Impact |
|------|------|--------|--------|
| Oysters | #2 | ✅ Stealth Chowder | Best zinc source ✓ |

**Assessment:** Menu + beverages provides ~725mg vitamin C/day. Supplementation bridges gap to 1000-2000mg target.

#### 2. ZINC - IMPROVED ✓
Best sources: Oysters (#1), beef, pumpkin seeds
- Beef and pumpkin seeds are in menu
- Oysters added via Stealth Seafood Chowder
- **Assessment:** ~85% of optimal

#### 3. MAGNESIUM - MODERATE
Best sources: Pumpkin seeds, spinach, chia, black beans
- All are in menu but not emphasized
- **Assessment:** ~70% of optimal

#### 4. SELENIUM - CLOSED ✓
Best source: Brazil nuts (2/day = 100% DV)
- Brazil nuts added to daily routine
- Salmon provides additional selenium
- **Assessment:** 100%+ of optimal

## SUMMARY

### Strengths:
✅ Liver 2x/week (most nutrient-dense food)
✅ Wild salmon frequently (omega-3, B12)
✅ Daily spinach (folate)
✅ Quality proteins throughout
✅ MTHFR-compliant (no enriched foods)

### Critical Fix Needed:
✅ **VITAMIN C** - Addressed with daily OJ, beverages, and bell peppers (~725mg/day from food). Supplement remaining 275-1275mg.

### Completed Improvements:
✅ Oysters added (Stealth Seafood Chowder) - zinc gap closed
✅ Vitamin C beverages added (OJ, Citrus Sunrise, Berry Lemonade, Kiwi Colada)
✅ Brazil nuts added (2/day) - selenium gap closed
✅ Bell peppers daily (side with every savory meal) - vitamin C boosted
✅ Bone broth added (gut healing, minerals)
✅ Fermented foods added (sauerkraut, kimchi, coconut yogurt) - BH4/probiotic support
✅ Menu simplified for whole family (no restrictions)

### Remaining Opportunities:
- Add mussels/clams to chowder (+1 point)
- Add beef heart to burgers (+1 point)
- Supplementation bridges vitamin C to 1000-2000mg target

### Bottom Line:
The menu is **excellent** for nutrient density. You're hitting 5 of the top 10 most nutrient-dense foods (liver, oysters, sardines, salmon, spinach). With daily vitamin C beverages and modest supplementation, the BH4/MTHFR needs are well covered.
